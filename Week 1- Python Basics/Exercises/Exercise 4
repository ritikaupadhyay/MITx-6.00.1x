#Below are some short Python programs. For each program, answer the associated question.

#Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong.

#This question is going to ask you what some simple loops print out. If you're asked what code like this prints:

#num = 5
#if num > 2:
#    print(num)
#    num -= 1
#print(num)

#write what it prints out, separating what appears on a new line by a comma and a space. So the answer for the above code would be:

#5, 4
#If a given loop will not terminate, write the phrase 'infinite loop' (no quotes) in the box. Recall that you can stop an infinite loop in your program by typing CTRL+c in the console.

#Note: What does +=, -=, *=, /= stand for?

num = 0
while num <= 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1

print("Outside of loop")
print(num) 
#0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'Outside of loop', 6



numberOfLoops = 0
numberOfApples = 2
while numberOfLoops < 10:
    numberOfApples *= 2
    numberOfApples += numberOfLoops
    numberOfLoops -= 1
print("Number of apples: " + str(numberOfApples))
#infinte loop

    
num = 10
while num > 3:
    num -= 1
    print(num) 
#9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3

    
num = 10
while True:
    if num < 7:
        print('Breaking out of loop')
        break
    print(num)
    num -= 1
print('Outside of loop')
#10, 9, 8, 7, 'Breaking out of loop', 'Outside of loop'


    
num = 100
while not False:
    if num < 0:
        break
print('num is: ' + str(num)) 
#infinite loop
