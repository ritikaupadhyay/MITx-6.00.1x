#For each of the following expressions, indicate the value returned, or if the evaluation would lead to an error, 
#write the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes). While you could simply type these expressions 
#into your IDE, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic Python expressions.


"a" + "bc"
#abc

3 * "bc"
#bcbcbc


"3" * "bc"
#error

"abcd"[2]
#c


"abcd"[0:2]
#ab


"abcd"[:2]
#ab

"abcd"[2:]
#cd
