# Hangman game
#

# The computer must select a word at random from the list of available words that was provided in words.txt.
# The functions for loading the word list and selecting a random word have already been provided for you in ps3_hangman.py.
# The game must be interactive; the flow of the game should go as follows:

# At the start of the game, let the user know how many letters the computer's word contains.
# Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.
# The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.
# After each round, you should also display to the user the partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the user has not yet guessed.

# Some additional rules of the game:
# A user is allowed 8 guesses. Make sure to remind the user of how many guesses s/he has left after each round.
# Assume that players will only ever submit one character at a time (A-Z).
# A user loses a guess only when s/he guesses incorrectly.

# If the user guesses the same letter twice, do not take away a guess - instead, print a message letting them know they've
# already guessed that letter and ask them to try again.

# The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses.
# If the player runs out of guesses (s/he "loses"), reveal the word to the user when the game ends.

# You don't need to understand this helper code,
