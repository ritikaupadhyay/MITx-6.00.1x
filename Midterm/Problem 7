# Problem 7
# 20/20 points (graded)
# Assume you are given two dictionaries d1 and d2, each with integer keys and integer values. You are also given a function f, that takes
# in two integers, performs an unknown operation on them, and returns a value.

# Write a function called dict_interdiff that takes in two dictionaries (d1 and d2). The function will return a tuple of two
# dictionaries: a dictionary of the intersect of d1 and d2 and a dictionary of the difference of d1 and d2, calculated as follows:
# intersect: The keys to the intersect dictionary are keys that are common in both d1 and d2. To get the values of the intersect
# dictionary, look at the common keys in d1 and d2 and apply the function f to these keys' values -- the value of the common key in d1 is
# the first parameter to the function and the value of the common key in d2 is the second parameter to the function. Do not implement f
# inside your dict_interdiff code -- assume it is defined outside.
# difference: a key-value pair in the difference dictionary is (a) every key-value pair in d1 whose key appears only in d1 and not in d2
# or (b) every key-value pair in d2 whose key appears only in d2 and not in d1.

# Here are two examples:
# If f(a, b) returns a + b
# d1 = {1:30, 2:20, 3:30, 5:80}
# d2 = {1:40, 2:50, 3:60, 4:70, 6:90}
# then dict_interdiff(d1, d2) returns ({1: 70, 2: 70, 3: 90}, {4: 70, 5: 80, 6: 90})
# If f(a, b) returns a > b
# d1 = {1:30, 2:20, 3:30}
# d2 = {1:40, 2:50, 3:60}
# then dict_interdiff(d1, d2) returns ({1: False, 2: False, 3: False}, {})

#    '''
#    d1, d2: dicts whose keys and values are integers
#    Returns a tuple of dictionaries according to the instructions above
